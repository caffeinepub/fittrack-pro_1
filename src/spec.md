# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix dropdown menu scrolling and resolve workout page issues.

**Planned changes:**
- Make all dropdown menus scrollable when content exceeds viewport height, especially exercise selection dropdowns
- Fix workout page functionality and display issues

**User-visible outcome:** Users can scroll through long dropdown menus to select exercises, and the workout page works properly without errors.
