# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a home page with navigation and enable full CRUD operations for the exercise library, plus expand muscle group and equipment type options.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a home page at "/" with navigation to Exercise Library, Workouts, Log Weight, and Progress
- Add create, edit, and delete functionality for exercises in the exercise library
- Add "Full Body" as a muscle group option
- Add Treadmill, Assault Bike, Bike, and Stairmaster as equipment type options

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate from a central home page to all major sections, and can fully manage their exercise library by adding new exercises, editing existing ones, and deleting unwanted exercises. Additional muscle group and equipment options are available for exercise categorization.
