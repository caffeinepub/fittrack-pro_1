# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Capitalize muscle group display text throughout the application UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Transform muscle group text to display with capitalized first letters (e.g., 'chest' → 'Chest', 'back' → 'Back')
- Apply capitalization in ExerciseCard component badges
- Apply capitalization in ExerciseLibrary filter buttons
- Apply capitalization in exercise creation and edit forms
- Keep backend storage format unchanged (lowercase)

**User-visible outcome:** All muscle group text displays with proper capitalization throughout the application while maintaining consistent data storage.
