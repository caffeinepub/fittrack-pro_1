# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Pre-populate the exercise library with 30 predefined exercises covering various muscle groups and equipment types.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 30 exercises to the backend with specific names, equipment types (Free Weight, Machine, Dumbbell, Cable), and muscle groups (lower body, chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, core)
- Update the seed functionality in the ExerciseLibrary page to populate these 30 exercises
- Prevent duplicate exercises when seeding multiple times

**User-visible outcome:** Users can seed the exercise library with 30 predefined exercises covering all major muscle groups and equipment types, making it immediately usable for creating workouts.
